# Vertical Profiles for different Cloud Types
As part of an in-depth analysis of the characteristics of the different ICON simulations, it become apparent that a comparison of different vertical profiles will be beneficial. Here, it is described 
* how vertical profiles for different cloud types are derived and 
* how the python package `nawdex_analysis`is used for that purpose

## General Structure of Intended Profile Data
