# NAWDEX Analysis Toolset
## General Description
This is a set of tools developed for the anaylsis of ICON simulations during the NAWDEX campaign. The study is done together with Aiko Voigt and will focus on cloud radiative effects in the Northern Atlantic and its dependence on grid spacing and microphysics parameterization.
