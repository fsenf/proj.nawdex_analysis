# NAWDEX Analysis Toolset
## General Description
This is a set of tools developed for the anaylsis of ICON simulations during the NAWDEX campaign. The study is done together with Aiko Voigt and will focus on cloud radiative effects in the Northern Atlantic and its dependence on grid spacing and microphysics parameterization.

## Data 
Two types of data go into the study: (i) observational data derived from Meteosat SEVIRI including cloud mask, cloud typing and long- and short-wave radiative fluxes, and (ii) simulation data obtained from differently configured ICON runs.

## Method
The simulation data will be transfered to observation space. Thereafter, synthetic cloud mask and typing is derived via the NWCSAF software. Cloud radiative effects are calculated. For observations, simulated clear-sky fluxes are used.
